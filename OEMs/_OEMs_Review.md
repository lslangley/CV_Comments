#### USDOT asked the following 9 questions for anyone to comment on. Some of the OEMS below commented generally, some commented specifically on one or more of the questions, and some provided answers to all 9 questions. The questions posed by USDOT were the following:

1. Please provide information on what existing or future technologies could be used for V2X communications, including, but not limited to, DSRC, LTE C–V2X and 5G New Radio. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each technology? What is the timeframe for deployment of technologies not yet in production? Please provide data supporting your position.
2. Of the V2X communications technologies previously discussed, at present only DSRC is permitted to be used in the 5.9 GHz spectrum band for transportation applications. If that allocation were to be changed to allow any communication technology for transportation applications, could DSRC and other technologies (e.g., C–V2X, 5G or any future technology) operate in the same spectrum band or even the same channel without interference? Why or why not? If there are any technical challenges to achieving this goal, what are they and how can they be overcome?
3. To what extent is it technically feasible for multiple V2X communications technologies and protocols to be interoperable with one another? Why or why not? Can this be done in a way that meets the performance requirements for safety of life applications, as they were discussed in the V2V NPRM? What additional equipment would be needed to achieve interoperability or changes in standards and specifications? What is the projected cost of any necessary changes? How soon can these changes and equipment prototypes be available for testing?
4. To what extent is it technically feasible for different generations of the same V2X communications technologies and protocols to be interoperable with one another? Why or why not? Can this be done in a way that meets the performance requirements for safety of life applications? What additional equipment or changes in standards and specifications would be needed to achieve interoperability? What is the projected cost of any necessary changes?
5. Even if they are interoperable across different technologies and generations of the same technology, would there be advantages if a single communications protocol were to be used for V2V safety communications? What about other V2X safety applications, such as those involving V2I and V2P communications?
6. How would the development of alternative communication technologies affect other V2I and V2P communications, such as those supporting mobility or environmental applications? Do these applications have the same or different interoperability issues as V2V safety communications? Do different V2X applications (e.g., platooning) have different communication needs, particularly latency?
7. Do different communication technologies present different issues concerning physical security (i.e., how to integrate alternative communication technologies into vehicle systems), message security (i.e., SCMS design or other approaches), or other issues such as cybersecurity or privacy? Would these concerns be affected if multiple but still interoperable communication technologies are used rather than one?
8. How could communications technologies (DSRC, C–V2X, 5G or some other technology) be leveraged to support current and emerging automated vehicle applications? Will different communication technologies be used in different ways? How?
9. How could deployments, both existing and planned, assess communications needs and determine which technologies are most appropriate and whether and how interoperability could be achieved?

#### Table of responses from various Organizations to the USDOT request for comments:

#
Type | Name | C-V2X | DSRC | Review | Document Link
---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
OEM | America Honda| X | X | Honda responded to all 9 questions and provided the following insight. Honda was an early supporter of DSRC. They recently conducted a reassessment due to continuous delays. The reassessment finds that the spectrum should be shared between 5G and future DSRC, all 7 channels must be preserved for automotive V2X, and a single communications protocol is critical for V2X BSMs to provide benefit. |[Link]( https://github.com/lslangley/CV_Comments/blob/master/OEMs/Comment_from_American_Honda_Motor_Co_.pdf)
OEM | Ford | X | | Ford submitted a response to all 9 of USDOT's questions. Ford also submitted a concept of functional interoperability which they state will allow for DSRC and Cellular based V2X to achieve functional interoperability. In the end, Ford believes that the technologies will converge. "We define functional interoperability as the ability for the information that vehicles and other transportation stakeholders exchange through V2X to be semantically coherent regardless of the medium through which such information is delivered, as long as safety critical requirements (for example latency and reliability) are met." Interoperability across the two wavelengths (DSRC and Cellular) will need an interworking point via and RSU.  | [Link](https://github.com/lslangley/CV_Comments/blob/master/OEMs/Comment_from_Ford_Motor_Company.pdf)
OEM | GM | |X | GM added DSRC to Cadillac CTS models in 2017 and shorly there after announced that they would expand V2X  to all Cadillac models beginning in 2023. GM supports preserving the spectrum for DSRC. GM also notes that they are aware C-V2x holding promise and is interested in seeing how C-V2X demonstrates supplementary or improved benefits to the proven capabilities of DSRC.  | [Link](https://github.com/lslangley/CV_Comments/blob/master/OEMs/Comment_from_General_Motors_Company.pdf)
OEM | Tesla | X| |Tesla states that V2X communications not be mandatory claiming that what is currently known is speculative. Tesla states that the 5.9GHz spectrum should be preserved for V2X communications of DSRC and C-V2X. Tesla cites that C-V2X is under consideration by the European Union and  the only technology under consideration in China. "Empowering C-V2X offers a greater likelihood of harmonization across global markets, which increases the likelihood of adoption."    | [Link](https://github.com/lslangley/CV_Comments/blob/master/OEMs/Comment_from_Tesla%2C_Inc_.pdf)
OEM | Toyota | | X|Toyota states that DSRC is the only choice available today and that they encourage NHTSA and FHWA to take leadership in mandating this technology or an "if equipped" standard.  | [Link](https://github.com/lslangley/CV_Comments/blob/master/OEMs/Comment_from_Toyota_Motor_North_America%2C_Inc_.pdf)
