Type | Name | C-V2X | DSRC | Summary | Document Link
---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
Organization | Next Generation Mobile Networks (NGMN) | X | | * 30 million safety use cases to date. * Supports a 3GPP standardization for short and long-range communications compliant with C-ITS ecosystem. * Bicyclist and Pedestrian applicability * Believes C-V2X is superior to IEE802.11 Standards. * Previously recommended USDOT stay technology neutral * C-V2X solutions currently over LTE should transition easily to 5G.  |[Link](https://github.com/lslangley/CV_Comments/blob/master/Organizations/181122_NGMN_recommendations_to_EC_on_C-ITS.pdf)
Organization | 5G Automotive Association | X | | Would like to see C-V2X and DSRC share 5.9 GHz V2X band. Believe C-V2X is superior to DSRC for the following five reasons: **1.** superior radio performance that enables new and improved V2X safety and other applications **2.** the ability to leverage commercial cellular networks **3.** an evolutionary path to 5G that will unlock advanced V2X services supporting autonomous driving **4.** an accelerated timeline for deployment **5.** optimized security protocol.| [Link](https://github.com/lslangley/CV_Comments/blob/master/Organizations/Comment_from_5G_Automotive_Association.pdf)
Organization | AAA | X | X | * AAA supports further testing to determine if communication technologies can safely share the 5.9GHz band to catalyze delivery of promised safety improvements. * They call for standardization of technology and communication methods to encourage continued testing by local jurisdictions. [Link](https://github.com/lslangley/CV_Comments/blob/master/Organizations/Comment_from_AAA.pdf)
Organization | AASHTO | X | | * Calls for the current 5.9 GHz band continue to be reserved for transportation safety purposes. * Claims DSRC is the only proven technology and USDOT should fully support it. * Also, supports the research, development, and deployment of other CV technologies. * AASHTO fully responded to all 9 of USDOT's questions.

Organization | American Trucking Association (ATA) | X | X | ATA supports reserving 5.9GHz spectrum and 7 allocated channels for CV solutions. ATA recommends the following principles: **1.** Same-Channel Coexistence: Non-DSRC communications technology for V2X applications must not disrupt the current DSRC-based deployments that are occurring under existing FCC rules. DSRC use should continue to remain across all seven allocated channels without interference. **2.** Technology Interoperability and Backward Compatibility: Non-DSRC technology used for V2X communications should be backward compatible and interoperable with deployed systems, so that safety data can be exchanged among V2X-equipped vehicles, regardless of which V2X communications technology is on each vehicle. **3.** Testing: Any new communication technology under consideration for V2X applications should be rigorously tested, including around-the-clock real-world roadway safety testing, to ensure that it achieves the goals of same-channel coexistence, technology interoperability, and backward compatibility. | [Link](https://github.com/lslangley/CV_Comments/blob/master/Organizations/Comment_from_American_Trucking_Associations.pdf)
Organization | AMPO | X | X | Supports AASHTO's submitted comments with the following additional points: **1.** Based on existing data and technology applications, AMPO does not feel it is appropriate at this time to favor or rule out a technology. **2.** Data-sharing between private and public sector should be encouraged. **3.** Support and encourage the MPO role of providing public, partner, and stakeholder education, involvement, and engagement. **4.** Support the MPO role of maintaining the state of good repair to provide venues to test successful CAV technology.| [Link](https://github.com/lslangley/CV_Comments/blob/master/Organizations/Comment_from_Association_of_Metropolitan_Planning_Organizations.pdf)
Organization | CTIA | X | | CTIA support four notions: **1.** Wireless Technology provides speed, capacity, and reliability for automotive applications. **2.** Committed to developing technologies. 3GPP 4G LTE based C-V2X standards covers many safety CV use cases. In 2019, 3GPP will be releasing 5G LTE based C-V2X standards. **3.** USDOT should continue coordination with FCC regarding allowing C-V2X providers to share the 5.9 GHz spectrum. **4.** The wireless industry will continue to provide the network, device and component resources critical to achieving V2X Communications.| [Link](https://github.com/lslangley/CV_Comments/blob/master/Organizations/Comment_from_CTIA.pdf)
Organization | Consumer Reports |||* All new cars should be required to be able to send and receive safety messages in a mutually intelligible manner so that safety benefits reach all consumers, not just those who can afford to buy expensive add-ons. * As various technologies are being developed, there still should be dedicated and adequate spectrum available exclusively for vehicle safety purposes. * DOT must recognize that consumers deserve to know what their car is transmitting, and who has access to this information. * should set implementation time frames for V2X standards that recognize the urgency of bringing lifesaving technology to consumers’ vehicles. DOT should set relevant performance standards and test methods within the next 18 months, building on its past work in this area, and require the technology to be standard on all new vehicles no later than 2025. **Additional responses provided for Questions 7,8 and 9** [Link](https://github.com/lslangley/CV_Comments/blob/master/Organizations/Comment_from_Consumer_Reports.pdf)

#### USDOT asked the following 9 questions for anyone to comment on. Some of the organizations below commented generally, some commented specifically on one or more of the questions, and some provided answers to all 9 questions. The questions posed by USDOT were the following:

1. Please provide information on what existing or future technologies could be used for V2X communications, including, but not limited to, DSRC, LTE C–V2X and 5G New Radio. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each technology? What is the timeframe for deployment of technologies not yet in production? Please provide data supporting your position.
2. Of the V2X communications technologies previously discussed, at present only DSRC is permitted to be used in the 5.9 GHz spectrum band for transportation applications. If that allocation were to be changed to allow any communication technology for transportation applications, could DSRC and other technologies (e.g., C–V2X, 5G or any future technology) operate in the same spectrum band or even the same channel without interference? Why or why not? If there are any technical challenges to achieving this goal, what are they and how can they be overcome?
3. To what extent is it technically feasible for multiple V2X communications technologies and protocols to be interoperable with one another? Why or why not? Can this be done in a way that meets the performance requirements for safety of life applications, as they were discussed in the V2V NPRM? What additional equipment would be needed to achieve interoperability or changes in standards and specifications? What is the projected cost of any necessary changes? How soon can these changes and equipment prototypes be available for testing?
4. To what extent is it technically feasible for different generations of the same V2X communications technologies and protocols to be interoperable with one another? Why or why not? Can this be done in a way that meets the performance requirements for safety of life applications? What additional equipment or changes in standards and specifications would be needed to achieve interoperability? What is the projected cost of any necessary changes?
5. Even if they are interoperable across different technologies and generations of the same technology, would there be advantages if a single communications protocol were to be used for V2V safety communications? What about other V2X safety applications, such as those involving V2I and V2P communications?
6. How would the development of alternative communication technologies affect other V2I and V2P communications, such as those supporting mobility or environmental applications? Do these applications have the same or different interoperability issues as V2V safety communications? Do different V2X applications (e.g., platooning) have different communication needs, particularly latency?
7. Do different communication technologies present different issues concerning physical security (i.e., how to integrate alternative communication technologies into vehicle systems), message security (i.e., SCMS design or other approaches), or other issues such as cybersecurity or privacy? Would these concerns be affected if multiple but still interoperable communication technologies are used rather than one?
8. How could communications technologies (DSRC, C–V2X, 5G or some other technology) be leveraged to support current and emerging automated vehicle applications? Will different communication technologies be used in different ways? How?
9. How could deployments, both existing and planned, assess communications needs and determine which technologies are most appropriate and whether and how interoperability could be achieved?
