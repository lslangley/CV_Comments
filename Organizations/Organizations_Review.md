Organization | Next Generation Mobile Networks (NGMN) | X | | * 30 million safety use cases to date. * Supports a 3GPP standardization for short and long-range communications compliant with C-ITS ecosystem. * Bicyclist and Pedestrian applicability * Believes C-V2X is superior to IEE802.11 Standards. * Previously recommended USDOT stay technology neutral * C-V2X solutions currently over LTE should transition easily to 5G.  |[Link](https://github.com/lslangley/CV_Comments/blob/master/Organizations/181122_NGMN_recommendations_to_EC_on_C-ITS.pdf)
Organization | 5G Automotive Association | X | | Would like to see C-V2X and DSRC share 5.9 GHz V2X band. Believe C-V2X is superior to DSRC for the following five reasons: **1.** superior radio performance that enables new and improved V2X safety and other applications **2.** the ability to leverage commercial cellular networks **3.** an evolutionary path to 5G that will unlock advanced V2X services supporting autonomous driving **4.** an accelerated timeline for deployment **5.** optimized security protocol.| [Link](https://github.com/lslangley/CV_Comments/blob/master/Organizations/Comment_from_5G_Automotive_Association.pdf)
Organization | AAA | X | X | * AAA supports further testing to determine if communication technologies can safely share the 5.9GHz band to catalyze delivery of promised safety improvements. * They call for standardization of technology and communication methods to encourage continued testing by local jurisdictions.

Organization | American Trucking Association (ATA) | X | X | ATA supports reserving 5.9GHz spectrum and 7 allocated channels for CV solutions. ATA recommends the following principles: **1.** Same-Channel Coexistence: Non-DSRC communications technology for V2X applications must not disrupt the current DSRC-based deployments that are occurring under existing FCC rules. DSRC use should continue to remain across all seven allocated channels without interference. **2.** Technology Interoperability and Backward Compatibility: Non-DSRC technology used for V2X communications should be backward compatible and interoperable with deployed systems, so that safety data can be exchanged among V2X-equipped vehicles, regardless of which V2X communications technology is on each vehicle. **3.** Testing: Any new communication technology under consideration for V2X applications should be rigorously tested, including around-the-clock real-world roadway safety testing, to ensure that it achieves the goals of same-channel coexistence, technology interoperability, and backward compatibility. | [Link](https://github.com/lslangley/CV_Comments/blob/master/Organizations/Comment_from_American_Trucking_Associations.pdf)
Organization | AMPO | X | X | Supports AASHTO's submitted comments with the following additional points: **1.** Based on existing data and technology applications, AMPO does not feel it is appropriate at this time to favor or rule out a technology. **2.** Data-sharing between private and public sector should be encouraged. **3.** Support and encourage the MPO role of providing public, partner, and stakeholder education, involvement, and engagement. **4.** Support the MPO role of maintaining the state of good repair to provide venues to test successful CAV technology.| [Link](https://github.com/lslangley/CV_Comments/blob/master/Organizations/Comment_from_Association_of_Metropolitan_Planning_Organizations.pdf)
Organization | CTIA | X | | CTIA support four notions: **1.** Wireless Technology provides speed, capacity, and reliability for automotive applications. **2.** Committed to developing technologies. 3GPP 4G LTE based C-V2X standards covers many safety CV use cases. In 2019, 3GPP will be releasing 5G LTE based C-V2X standards. **3.** USDOT should continue coordination with FCC regarding allowing C-V2X providers to share the 5.9 GHz spectrum. **4.** The wireless industry will continue to provide the network, device and component resources critical to achieving V2X Communications.| [Link](https://github.com/lslangley/CV_Comments/blob/master/Organizations/Comment_from_CTIA.pdf)
Organization | Consumer Reports |||* All new cars should be required to be able to send and receive safety messages in a mutually intelligible manner so that safety benefits reach all consumers, not just those who can afford to buy expensive add-ons. * As various technologies are being developed, there still should be dedicated and adequate spectrum available exclusively for vehicle safety purposes. * DOT must recognize that consumers deserve to know what their car is transmitting, and who has access to this information. * should set implementation time frames for V2X standards that recognize the urgency of bringing lifesaving technology to consumers’ vehicles. DOT should set relevant performance standards and test methods within the next 18 months, building on its past work in this area, and require the technology to be standard on all new vehicles no later than 2025. **Additional responses provided for Questions 7,8 and 9** [Link](https://github.com/lslangley/CV_Comments/blob/master/Organizations/Comment_from_Consumer_Reports.pdf)

Organization | IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards Committee (LMSC) | | X | Provided answers to all 9 USDOT questions. **1.** Interoperability is key. LTE and NR V2X is not currently interoperable with DSRC or NGV. **2.** Shared spectrum is possible if certain safety function such as interoperability, coexistence, compatibility, and fairness with DSRC as defined by IEEE are met. **3.**  Interoperability is possible but will require LTE to be interoperable with DSRC OBUs. **4.** IEEE P802.11bd will have these intergenerational interoperability capabilities available for use by upper layer applications including safety of life applications.**5** IEEE 802 does not have comments at this time. **6** IEEE 802 does not have comments at this time. **7**  Communications operating in the 5.9 GHz spectrum typically use SCMS. If integrating newer generations of radio or alternative radio technologies, care needs to be taken to ensure that identities and privacy aren’t compromised. **8.** IEEE 802 does not have comments at this time. **9.** For DSRC there are 2 requirements 1. a receiver and transmitter of DSRC frames and 2. Enhance communication protocols so enhanced stations can detect and distinguish capabilities other enhanced stations in the vicinity.  | [Link](https://github.com/lslangley/CV_Comments/blob/master/Organizations/Comment_from_IEEE_802_LAN_MAN_Standards_Committee.pdf)
