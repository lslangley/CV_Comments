#### USDOT asked the following 9 questions for anyone to comment on. Some of the Jurisdictions below commented generally, some commented specifically on one or more of the questions, and some provided answers to all 9 questions. The questions posed by USDOT were the following:

1. Please provide information on what existing or future technologies could be used for V2X communications, including, but not limited to, DSRC, LTE C–V2X and 5G New Radio. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each technology? What is the timeframe for deployment of technologies not yet in production? Please provide data supporting your position.
2. Of the V2X communications technologies previously discussed, at present only DSRC is permitted to be used in the 5.9 GHz spectrum band for transportation applications. If that allocation were to be changed to allow any communication technology for transportation applications, could DSRC and other technologies (e.g., C–V2X, 5G or any future technology) operate in the same spectrum band or even the same channel without interference? Why or why not? If there are any technical challenges to achieving this goal, what are they and how can they be overcome?
3. To what extent is it technically feasible for multiple V2X communications technologies and protocols to be interoperable with one another? Why or why not? Can this be done in a way that meets the performance requirements for safety of life applications, as they were discussed in the V2V NPRM? What additional equipment would be needed to achieve interoperability or changes in standards and specifications? What is the projected cost of any necessary changes? How soon can these changes and equipment prototypes be available for testing?
4. To what extent is it technically feasible for different generations of the same V2X communications technologies and protocols to be interoperable with one another? Why or why not? Can this be done in a way that meets the performance requirements for safety of life applications? What additional equipment or changes in standards and specifications would be needed to achieve interoperability? What is the projected cost of any necessary changes?
5. Even if they are interoperable across different technologies and generations of the same technology, would there be advantages if a single communications protocol were to be used for V2V safety communications? What about other V2X safety applications, such as those involving V2I and V2P communications?
6. How would the development of alternative communication technologies affect other V2I and V2P communications, such as those supporting mobility or environmental applications? Do these applications have the same or different interoperability issues as V2V safety communications? Do different V2X applications (e.g., platooning) have different communication needs, particularly latency?
7. Do different communication technologies present different issues concerning physical security (i.e., how to integrate alternative communication technologies into vehicle systems), message security (i.e., SCMS design or other approaches), or other issues such as cybersecurity or privacy? Would these concerns be affected if multiple but still interoperable communication technologies are used rather than one?
8. How could communications technologies (DSRC, C–V2X, 5G or some other technology) be leveraged to support current and emerging automated vehicle applications? Will different communication technologies be used in different ways? How?
9. How could deployments, both existing and planned, assess communications needs and determine which technologies are most appropriate and whether and how interoperability could be achieved?

#### Table of responses from various Organizations to the USDOT request for comments:

#
Type | Name | C-V2X | DSRC | CV PFS Member | Review | Document Link
---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |---- |
Jurisdiction | Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) | |X|X| ADOT cites a lack of endorsement of DSRC from USDOT as creating uncertainty and delays in implementation and calls for USDOT to endorse DSRC due t it's proven capabilities. | [Link](https://github.com/lslangley/CV_Comments/blob/master/Jurisdictions/Comment_from_Arizona_Department_of_Transportation.pdf)
Jurisdiction | California Department of Transportation (CALTRANS)| |X | X| CALTRANS is a pioneer of DSRC deployment and believes DSRC will continue to improve safety and mobility of vehicles using V2V and V1 applications. CALTRANS responded to each of USDOT's 9 questions. In their answers, CALTRANS notes DSRC having dedicated spectrum allows for better security and lower cost than current C-V2X deployments. DSRC has no recurring monthly fees unlike cellular based solutions. DSRC also is not reliant on carriers for system infrastructure robustness. Similar concerns are noted for 5G based CV solutions. CALTRANS discourages sharing the spectrum band with non-DSRC technologies because they are likely to cause harmful interference or limit DSRC operation completely.   [Link](https://github.com/lslangley/CV_Comments/blob/master/Jurisdictions/Comment_from_California_Department_of_Transportation.pdf)
Jurisdiction | Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) |X |X | X| CDOT submitted answers to each of the 9 USDOT questions. CDOT believes that the spectrum should be dedicated to safety critical applications regardless of communication technology. CDOT is testing interoperability across communication technologies, generations of technologies, and across use cases of a specific roadway. | [Link]( https://github.com/lslangley/CV_Comments/blob/master/Jurisdictions/Comment_from_Colorado_Department_of_Transportation.pdf)
Jurisdiction | Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT) | | X| X| DelDOT supports preserving the spectrum for safety applications. DelDOT notes that the lack of endorsement of DSRC by USDOT has caused unnecessary delays but is still hopeful for DSRC. DelDOT also notes that they are aware of advancements in C-V2X and 5G and will implement technologies which support in performance, reliability, security, maintainability, and costs.  [Link] (https://github.com/lslangley/CV_Comments/blob/master/Jurisdictions/Comment_from_Delaware_Department_of_Transportation.pdf)
Jurisdiction | DriveOhio | | X| X| DriveOhio answered each of USDOT's 9 questions and added an AECOM drafter AV/CV Application Feasibility & Exploration Report. DriveOhio notes that while interoperability or spectrum sharing may be technically possible, testing is critical. They support DSRC but remain open to testing new technologies  | [Link](https://github.com/lslangley/CV_Comments/blob/master/Jurisdictions/Comment_from_DriveOhio.pdf)
Jurisdiction | Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT)| | X|X|GDOT notes that the spectrum should be dedicated for DSRC CV solutions. GDOT also notes that All safety critical applications require zero latency, while traveler information based applications have no real latency requirements. | [Link](https://github.com/lslangley/CV_Comments/blob/master/Jurisdictions/Comment_from_Georgia_Department_of_Transportation.pdf)
Jurisdiction | Lake County (Illinois) DOT (LCDOT)|X | | | LCDOT notes that DSRC has significant financial impacts on larger agencies and multiple-agency collaboration like their PASSAGE program. LCDOT notes that 5G + ATMS would allow low cost and effective CV deployments. Privacy standards will need to be determined. | [Link](https://github.com/lslangley/CV_Comments/blob/master/Jurisdictions/Comment_from_Lake_County_Division_of_Transportation.pdf)
Jurisdiction | Maryland DOT (MDOT) | |X|X| MDOT answered all 9 questions. MDOT notes that future technologies should be complementary not competitive. MDOT does not support multiple technologies operating on the same spectrum. They also note that Cellular solutions in emergency situations have not been reliable and that the 5G deployment is unclear. The two top concerns regarding a shared spectrum are Standards and Interoperability and Latency / Prioritization.  | [Link](https://github.com/lslangley/CV_Comments/blob/master/Jurisdictions/Comment_from_Maryland_Department_of_Transportation.pdf)
Jurisdiction | Texas DOT (TxDOT) | |X |X | TcDOT responded to each of the 9 questions. TxDOT notes that delay in a federal mandate supporting DSRC has caused unnecessary delays in deployment. TxDOT strongly believes that a national initiative is critical to ensure proper interoperability and to keep from individual states establishing separate systems or regulations. | [Link](https://github.com/lslangley/CV_Comments/blob/master/Jurisdictions/Comment_from_Texas_Department_of_Transportation.pdf)
Jurisdiction| Utah DOT (UDOT) | | X|X | UDOT responded to each of the 9 questions. UDOT believes that focusing on DSRC for safety critical applications is appropriate. Emerging non-DSRC technologies are not currently available and when they do become available, they will likely require subscription fees, and they will likely create message clutter.  Further evaluation of evaluation technology is needed.  |[Link](https://github.com/lslangley/CV_Comments/blob/master/Jurisdictions/Comment_from_Utah_Department_of_Transportation.pdf)
Jurisdiction | City and County of Denver |X|||Denver remains technology agnostic. But they have many concerns and questions about C-V2X.  | [Link](https://github.com/lslangley/CV_Comments/blob/master/Jurisdictions/Comment_from_the_City_and_County_of_Denver.pdf)
